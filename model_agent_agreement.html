  <p>    Natural or legal Performers are acting under this Agreement as providers of professional Services in the frame of their

  </p> 
</div> 
<div class="ps_content_block"> <h2 class="bm_h4">A. Model</h2> 
  <p>Section A is applicable only to Performers registered under a Model Account.</p> 
  <p>By means of the present Agreement, I expressly mark my interest to render Services as a Performer on the Websites promoted by the
    Website Operator and its affiliates, which currently manages a business that markets products/services to consumers (B2C), which
    may include but is not limited to interactive live streaming video chat site (based on the one available at www.campalour.com)
    and broadcasting, according to the terms of this Agreement.</p> 
  <p>The Performer undertakes not to provide any illegal, harmful, obscene, hateful, racial, ethnic or any other objectionable content
    (such as defamatory, abusive, threatening, racially offensive, etc.) while rendering the Services under this Agreement.</p> 
  <p>In order to improve the efficiency of the above-mentioned Services, I am authorised to use the Help Desk provided by the Website
    Operator and/or its Services providers, whenever deemed convenient.</p> 
  <p>I hereby certify that I work independently and that the Website Operator does not possess any power of direction, subordination,
    or other kind of authority over me. Consequently, the present Agreement does not determine my place or schedule for rendering the
    Services. The Website Operator does not tell me what my lawful content or my Services will be, since I am fully aware, as a
    Performer, that I must provide reliable and efficient Services in full compliance with the applicable legislation and object of
    the present Agreement.</p> 
  <p>I hereby certify that I have read and understood the terms and conditions of the Websites that are applicable for Members of the
    Websites and I am aware of the level of quality and obligations that are implied in such terms and conditions. In the case of any
    questions to this regard, I can contact the Website Operator according to the contact details provided in this Agreement.</p> 
  <p>Performers may render Services in one or more of the areas/categories available on the Websites, which are subject to change
    without prior notice from the Website Operator, with respect to standard requirements related to the Websites environment and
    consumer experience intended by the Website Operator.</p> 
  <p>The Services will be rendered by me with total autonomy and technical independence. Therefore, I am completely responsible and
    liable for my own actions, videos, audio, chat, dialogue, instructional videos, and advice, as a consenting responsible adult, and
    all decisions related to the content of my actions as a Performer are made at my own discretion.</p> 
  <p>Notwithstanding the above, I am acting under this Agreement as a professional when rendering the Services. Nevertheless it is not
    intended that the Services rendered by me are to be viewed as being certified by public authorities or by any necessary
    accreditations, it being my responsibility to keep the end users duly aware of that fact. I understand that I am not in any way an
    employee of the Website Operator and/or of any other entity related to the Website Operator.</p> 
  <p>I hereby declare that under this Agreement I will only render high quality Services, I will not knowingly provide any wrongful or
    misleading information to the Member of the Websites and represent that I will be acting honestly and professionally at all
    times.</p> 
</div> 
<div class="ps_content_block"> <h2 class="bm_h4">B. Studio</h2> 
  <p>Section B is only applicable to Performers registered under a Studio Account.</p> 
  <p>The Studio enters into this Agreement with the intent to provide Services to the Website Operator. For this purpose, the Studio
    may contract with studio models. It is not our responsibility to limit the scope of liability for third parties, especially given
    the content of the next two paragraphs.</p> 
  <p>The Studio understands and agrees that the Services to be rendered by Studio Models (hereafter referred to as the "Studio Models
    Services") under the terms and conditions of the contract concluded between the Studio and Studio Models (hereafter referred to as
    the "Studio Model Contract") are of adult entertainment nature, namely, to perform live webcam shows and chat through the Studio’s
    equipment for the entertainment of Members all over the world, who have selected such Studio Models according to live streams,
    images, offline (teaser) and paid videos or receiving the broadcast.</p> 
  <p>The Studio understands and agrees that it is its responsibility to determine the terms and conditions of the Studio Model
    Contract, which the Studio will autonomously and independently determine without any influence from the Website Operator, provided
    that such Studio Model Contract does not result in the violation of the Studio's obligations under the present Agreement and while
    procuring that Studio Models must obey the rules that would be substantially similar to those of Clause 1.A in this Agreement.
    Accordingly, Studio Models will not be in a contractual or other relationship of any nature with the Website Operator. The Studio
    agrees that it will remain solely and completely responsible and liable for all the content, actions, shows, videos, chat,
    dialogue, and any other Studio Models Services rendered under the Studio Model Contract.</p> 
  <p>In order to improve the efficiency of the Studio Models Services, I, as a Studio, am authorised to use the Help Desk provided by
    the Website Operator and its affiliates, whenever deemed convenient.</p> 
  <p>I, as a Studio, hereby certify that I work independently and that the Website Operator and/or Agent of Website Operator do not
    possess any power of direction, subordination, or other kind of authority over me. Consequently, this Agreement does not determine
    the place or schedule for Studio Models to render the Studio Models Services, which are determined in the Studio Model Contract.
    The Website Operator and/or Agent of Website Operator do not tell me what my lawful content or the Studio Models Services will be,
    since I am fully aware, as a Studio, that I am responsible for Studio Models to render reliable and efficient services in full
    compliance with the applicable legislation and intended purpose of the Studio Model Contract.</p> 
  <p>I, as a Studio, hereby certify that I have read and understood the terms and conditions of the Websites that are applicable to
    Members of the Websites and I am aware of the level of quality and obligations that are provided in such terms and conditions. In
    the case of any questions to this regard, I can contact the Website Operator according to the contact details provided in this
    Agreement. In respect of this, I hereby certify that I am liable for Studio Models, in compliance with their obligations under the
    Studio Model Contract, to render the Studio Models Services according to the level of quality and obligations that are provided in
    the terms and conditions of the Websites that are applicable to Members of the Websites.</p> 
  <p>Studio is acting under this Agreement as a professional in the frame of the exercise of my business activities (as opposed to
    consumers) when rendering the Services and thus will be solely responsible for paying all applicable taxes. As a general rule, the
    Studio is required to provide invoices for all the Services rendered to the Website Operator. Such invoices will comply with all
    applicable state and federal laws, as the case may be. In case the Studio cannot provide an invoice to the Website Operator, the
    latter may generate a self-invoice. By acceptance of these terms and conditions, the Studio agrees to the Website Operator
    operating a self-invoicing system, if needed, and accepts each self-invoice issued by the Website Operator in respect of the
    Services provided by the Studio. It is not intended that the Studio is to be viewed as being certified by public authorities or by
    any necessary accreditation, it being the Studio's responsibility to keep the end users duly aware of that fact. As a Studio, I
    understand that I am not and that Studio Models are not in any way employees of the Website Operator and/or of any other entity
    related to the Website Operator.</p> 
  <p>I hereby commit, as a Studio, that under the Studio Model Contract, the Studio Models will render the Studio Models Services with
    high quality, will not knowingly provide any wrongful or misleading information to the Member of the Websites, and that the Studio
    Models will be acting honestly and professionally at all times.</p> 
  <p>The Studio further commits to guaranteeing that Studio Models respect the requirements applicable to the Studios as well as the
    requirements for Models as provided in Clause 1.A above.</p>

  <p>I acknowledge that the amount to be paid for the Services rendered, within the scope of this Agreement, will be published on my

    Services rendered, settlements with the Website Operator, statistics and other relevant information.</p> 
  <p>I understand and accept that the amounts to be paid by Website Operator to me will correspond to a certain percentage (varying
    according to the type of Services) of the chosen charge option (i.e., certain percentage of the price paid by the Members of the
    Websites to the Website Operator) as described above which percentage and charge options will be published on my registration
    Account and/or my sales page (which I can consult before rendering any Services). I understand and accept that my compensation
    will be limited to the aforementioned payment and that no royalty will be due to me for any original content uploaded by me to the

    exclusively the customers of Website Operator.</p> 
  <p>I confirm that the payment deadline for the services provided is always in the following month by the 15th of the month.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I acknowledge that payments to be paid for the Services rendered may be proportionally and adequately reduced in case of

    were imposed on me/ Studio Model stated in the Clause 8 of this Agreement.</p> 
  <p>The prices payable by Members and which also constitute the base for calculating amounts earned by me as described above are
    subject to change from time to time at Website Operator's sole discretion and without prior notification to me. In case of
    substantial change in the price charged to Members, I will have the option to terminate this Agreement when such material changes
    occur; otherwise continuing to provide Services through the Websites will be considered implicit acceptance of such changes.</p> 
  <p>Credit card fraud is a crime, and the Website Operator will do everything in its power to help local and international
    authorities to trace people committing such felonies. The Website Operator will not pay any fees in case of fraudulent purchases.
    The purchases must originate from the owner of the credit card or have permission from the owner for using their credit card. The
    Website Operator’s team does everything in its power to minimise the percentage of fraudulent purchases. If you know of anyone
    committing such activities please notify us, so that you can help us protect our Websites.</p>

</div> 
<div id="ps_terms_8" class="ps_content_block"> <h2 class="bm_h4">8th clause - basic rules for the provision of services</h2> 
  <p>The below-mentioned rules must be followed by all Performers rendering Services through the Websites. The Studios undertake to
    guarantee that Studio Models rendering Services on their behalf respect the rules below as well.</p> 
  <p>Performers must have a valid and approved registration on the Websites. Performer, or as the case may be, Studio Model appearing
    in the camera area or in the pictures through campalour.com must be registered under the given Account.</p> 
  <p>Broadcasting a pre-recorded video or still image instead of live camera stream is against the rules of the Websites. Violation of
    the rules is considered a breach of this Agreement and might result in monetary deduction, suspension of the Account, immediate
    ban from the Websites or the discontinuance of payouts.</p> 
  <p>Giving out and asking for personal information, including personal information of Members and Performer or Studio Models is
    against the rules. E-mail addresses from outside the Websites, online messenger IDs (such as: Yahoo!, MSN, ICQ, Skype, etc.),
    permanent addresses, etc. are considered personal information and are forbidden to
    be asked and/or provided.</p> 
  <p>Any kind of personal contact with Members of the Websites, soliciting for escort service, prostitution, asking for any form of
    compensation, is against the rules.</p> 
  <p>Underage sexual activity, bestiality, incest, demonstration of blood or animals and mimicking the above mentioned is against the
    rules. Role playing that includes an underage role is against the rules. Any attempt to display text material that is a celebrity
    name, offensive, suggests pedophilia, adolescence, bestiality or zoophilia, referring to elimination or consumption of any bodily
    waste or implying words that are unacceptable by the standards of good taste will lead to immediate and permanent suspension of
    the concerned account.</p> 
  <p>Advertising other websites or services is strictly prohibited, unless expressly allowed by the Website Operator in this
    Agreement.</p> 
  <p>All registered persons of an Account must be visible and recognisable in the camera area and in the pictures all the time
    (showing body parts only is not acceptable). Performers need to follow the basic category rules described in the Websites for each
    category of the Services regarding the number of persons, proper outfit, activities, etc.</p> 
  <p>In case the Performer or Studio Model, as the case may be, misled the paying Member about his/her/their gender, preferences, or
    activities, the Member is entitled to claim back any amounts paid. Promising Members certain performances for their tips or paid
    shows (private, fully private, group) and not acting on these promises after being tipped is also considered misleading and may
    result in returning any amounts received. Rejecting members' offers or requests (either in free or paid chats) is not considered
    misleading.</p> 
  <p>Sleeping in the camera area is prohibited.</p> 
  <p>You/Studio Models have the option to remove, expel, eject or ban impolite Members from your/their chat room, although it is
    against the rules to misuse this privilege. Making derogatory statements about other Performers/Studio Models or Members is
    prohibited. Performers/Studio Models are obliged to respect and follow the instructions of the Customer Service staff. If you need
    help, do not hesitate to contact our Customer Service.</p> 
  <p>In case of offence or violation of the rules, the Performer would be first warned by the Website Operator. However, in case of
    the egregious violation (e.g. advertising of other webcam websites and/or referring their direct links) the Website Operator
    reserves the right to fine the Performer immediately without giving a prior warning. The Website Operator reserves the right to
    fine the Performer in the case of offence, with the amount to be fined depending on the nature of such offence. The Website
    Operator is entitled to deduct such fines from any payments due to the Performer in accordance with the fine system listed
    below:</p>
